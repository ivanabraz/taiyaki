  ## About // Sobre
  HelloðŸ‘‹ My name is [Ivana Braz](http://github.com/ivanabraz).<br>
  <br>
  For this final work I've decided to materialize a personal project called **Taiyaki**. This concept store offers an unique gastronomic proposal, based on the iconic Japanese fish-shaped cake, adapting and carefully curating new flavours for people to enjoy.<br>
  <br>
  The brandâ€™s target is a younger public, and diving deeper on the consumption behaviour of these audiciences, I've found that people often prefer to pay with online methods rather than cash. And since youger people have a hectic lifestyle, can become in handy to order online and pick up the food/drinks on the go. So main idea for this ecommerce is to offer that possibility.<br>
  <br>
  People could buy through their cell phones and then pick up their orders at the physical store, or at one of the food trucks that are closest to them, and that will be scattered around the city.<br>
  <br>
  For this project I made the branding and montages of the products, the web design and the coding.
